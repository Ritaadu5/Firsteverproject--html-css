        <p>As the technology world evolves, there is a greater need for more people to work in the sector. However, the demand for female employees is low, with only 26.7% of females working in the sector.</p>
        <p>Tech Platform has created a safe space for females seeking to start or advancing their careers in technology. We offer excellent support and advice, as well as a forum where everyone can help each other and feel like a community, as well as professional advice through mentors.</p>
